# Governance

TEDY tokens don't just represent the defi platform, they also represent the community's say in the most impactful decisions. The TEDY protocol is designed to allow for adjustments to the emission schedule, platform fees, and other variables that shape the DEX. Revenue will be used to add features and improve the user experience. These important decisions should fall in the hands of the community, since TeddySwap is being created with community input and support and intended to help provide more tools to the Cardano ecosystem. 

The number of TEDY tokens you hold across yield farms and liquidity pools and the tokens you stake will all be counted when it comes to a vote. Votes will be held with plenty of notice and the community will have an opportunity to discuss their opinions on the matter. The TeddySwap team will execute plans based on any votes, and are happy to hear feedback from the community on what should be voted on as well.
