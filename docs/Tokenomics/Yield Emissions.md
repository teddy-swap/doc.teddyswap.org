# Yield Emissions

The tokenomics includes a large tranche that is reserved for platform rewards in the form of various emissions, such as Yield Farming and trading bonuses. 

The yield emission exists to encourage users to provide liquidity to the platform. Liquidity is one of the most important key performance indicators (KPIs) for a new DEX. The yield farm emission will halve every year, for the first 6 years. After that there will be an ongoing tail emission for several years following to ensure the long term sustainability of the protocol.

The yield emission can be adjusted up or down by 25% on any given emission period, thus allowing the platform to provide more yield when needed to encourage users to add liquidity or to offer trading bonuses so more people use the platform. When a lot of liquidity is available and less yield is necessary, the yield can be adjusted downwards to reduce dilution.

Total average yield emission over time is expressed in the following chart.
