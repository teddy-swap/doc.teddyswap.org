# Objectives

Our protocol objectives are:

1. Increase capital efficiency of Cardano stablecoins to bring more value to the Cardano ecosystem.
2. Provide fundamental infrastructure to allow users to effectively leverage stablecoins on Cardano.
3. Offer an attractive and conservative yield option to community members with low slippage and minimum impermanent loss.
