# Introduction

#### Coziest Stablecoin DEX on Cardano
The creation of TeddySwap stems from the fundamental belief that Cardano, due to its scientific approach and meticulous implementation process, is the most decentralized and secure platform, poised for domination within the cryptocurrency industry and future world financial operating system.

Looking at the Cardano ecosystem, it appears this blockchain is on the cusp of an inevitable explosion of the stablecoin ecosytem, and we believe TeddySwap has the potential to capture a significant market share of this fundamental sector of Cardano DeFi.

By launching this protocol, led by experienced developers and seasoned project leads, we believe TeddySwap can be a force for good for the Cardano ecosystem and significantly contribute to the growth of the ecosystem on Cardano’s road to becoming the #1 cryptocurrency.

The Cardano ecosystem, home to one of the largest organic communities and believers of true decentralization, is now at the optimal time for the launch of TeddySwap, a decentralized exchange focused on stable coins.

A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a type of cryptocurrency exchange that allows for peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies without the need for a central authority. DEXs offer a number of advantages over traditional exchanges, including increased security, greater privacy, and reduced reliance on third parties.

One key challenge with DEXs is liquidity: it can be difficult to find buyers or sellers for certain assets, especially if they are not widely traded. This problem is particularly acute for smaller, lesser-known cryptocurrencies, which may not have sufficient volume to sustain a liquid market.

Additionally, another common issue with traditional DEXs is facing impermanent loss. This is especially common with volatile assets with unpredictable price movements which causes liquidity providers to potentially alter their liquidity positions and face major losses due to this risk.

TeddySwap is a DEX built on the Cardano blockchain that aims to solve this problem by providing a platform for trading stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of a fiat currency or other assets.

A DEX that focuses on stablecoins on Cardano right now makes sense for multiple reasons:

1. Most liquidity in the cryptocurrency market is in stablecoins. At the time of this writing, four out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies are stablecoins, with a combined market cap of $133 billion. Stablecoins are a pillar of any flourishing cryptocurrency ecosystem.
2. Cardano is poised for rapid stablecoin growth with the planned launching of at least 5 stablecoins in 2023.
3. Liquidity providers can provide liquidity to stablecoins pairs and should experience less impermanent loss due to less volatile trading pairs, allowing DeFi investors to earn conservative and stable yield.

We believe these factors positon TeddySwap to help catapult Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem.

By focusing on stablecoins, TeddySwap is able to highly incentivize the liquidity of the most common stable pairs, while also fostering a DeFi environment not glorifying high risk or increasing the chances of impermanent loss.

Historically, the most trading activity is seen with stable assets, meaning this should TeddySwap should hypothetically see active trading volume, leading to more passive rewards for liquidity providers.

In this whitepaper, we describe the design, features, roadmap and team of TeddySwap, as well as the benefits it offers to users.
