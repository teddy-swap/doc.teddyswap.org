# What is the Honey Fee System

People who run Badgers to fulfil transactions on TeddySwap get paid to do so. When you give the Badgers more honey, it makes them prioritize your transactions. 

It is worth noting that the more tokens you get for your trade the higher the fees (just like a typical centralize exchange)

For example, if you expected to get 1000 iUSDT but the price went higher and you are getting 1500 iUSD instead, but you didn't provide enough honey to cover the higher trade, your transaction wont go through.

So people who pay more honey for their trades will be prioritized and more likely to have a successful trade.
