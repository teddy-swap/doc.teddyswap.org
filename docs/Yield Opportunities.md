# Yield Opportunities

TeddySwap offers a stablecoin DEX which requires various contributions from the community to operate. This includes off-chain bot operators and liquidity providers. These provide various yield strategies that anyone can take advantage of. 

## Liquidity Providers

Create dual-asset liquidity pairs, providing equal amounts of stablecoins, then stake those LP tokens to earn extra yield in Teddy tokens. 

## Off-chain Operators

[Run Badger/Batcher](https://docs.teddyswap.org/testnet-guide/how-to-run-a-batcher-badge) bots to earn platform fees over time. 

## Savings Vaults

You can stake your ADA and stablecoin assets in our savings vaults, and earn staking rewards and extra Teddy tokens on top.
